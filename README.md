# improving_neural_nets_python
Useful code for deep learning (hyperparameter tuning, regularization, optimization, ...) from scratch (not using existing deep learning frameworks).

Most of these codes are based on the Coursera course 'Improving Deep Neural Networks'.

## Theory

## Part 1: Practical aspects of Deep Learning

- Initialization schemes (zeros vs large random weights vs He init.): https://github.com/alzaia/improving_neural_nets_python/blob/master/01_initialization_methods.py.
- Regularization methods (no reg. vs L2 reg. vs dropout): https://github.com/alzaia/improving_neural_nets_python/blob/master/02_regularization_methods.py.

## Part 2: Optimization algorithms

- Mini-batch GD with momentum vs Adam optimization (momentum + RMSprop): https://github.com/alzaia/improving_neural_nets_python/blob/master/03_optimization_methods.py.

## Part 3: Hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization and deep learning frameworks
